Data Analysis portfolio using Vanilla Javascript and D3 framework

The folder contains code to my data analysis portfolio created using vanilla Javascript and D3 framework. 
The portfolio has been hosted on the netlify site: https://datavisualisationnihal.netlify.app/

Outcome: Using Javascript and D3 framework an updating bar graph has been created, which shows the
increase in rent for housing units over the past 10 years in Sydney and City of Parramatta (2006 and 2016). 

This portfolio has been created as part of an assignment for Urban Data and Science of Cities unit at the University of Sydney.
It will be regularly updated based on the upcoming assignments and projects. The data for this project
has been obtained from ABS table builder based on the census data of 2006 and 2016.
